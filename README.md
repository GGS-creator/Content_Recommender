# Content_Recommender
This program is created by Gagan.G.Saralaya on 10/2/2025 to act like the algorithm used in various social media sites
which involves scrolling through content.This program tries to understand what the 
user likes and prints the liked number, which the user liked as much as possible. And often it 
mixes things up and prints a random number from time to time and checks if the user likes 
the different number. The program also removes the number which has been liked by the user once but
the time spent on that number is less
Here we can associate the number as the type of content(eg- music,sports,comedy)
and using this program we can see if the user is into a certain type of content like music 
it also mixes things a little to see if the user is interested in some other things like sports
or comedy.If the user likes to watch comedy content more and has stopped liking sports content
the program removes it from the liked content, now comedy is in the liked content.
